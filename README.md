ifuio
=====

This is a C library containing a collection of input/output routines
for Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph data. It is a dependency for
the Nearby Supernova Factory pipeline. It originally went by the name
E3D_io_LCL and then by IFU_C_iolibs.

Originally the library included another I/O format called "MIDAS" but
this was stripped on importing the code to git.

**Dependencies:** cfitsio, wcslib
